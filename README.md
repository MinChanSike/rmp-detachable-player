# rmp-detachable-player

rmp-detachable-player is an open-source extension for [Radiant Media Player](https://www.radiantmediaplayer.com) 
allowing to attach/detach the player when scrolling into a page. As such the player can be visible at all time regardless 
of the page scrolling position.

This extension can be used as so or tuned with JavaScript/CSS to better fit your project design.

## Features
- Always-on-screen player - regardless of the page scrolling position - for a more immersive video experience
- Automatic resizing of player based on attach/detach states 
- Mobile-ready
- Works with video ads
- Easily extended with JavaScript and CSS

## Usage
See index.html for a working example. js/rmp-detach.js is commented for better understanding. 
If you use our paid features a license key is required. In a nutshell there are 3 components:

- JavaScript to handle the attach/detach logic and player settings/init
